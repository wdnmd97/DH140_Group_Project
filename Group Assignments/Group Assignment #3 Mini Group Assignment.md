# What are we talking about when we are talking about COVID vaccine?
## Proposal:https://github.com/wdnmd97/DH140_Group_Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Group%20Assignment%20%231:%20Project%20Proposal.md
## Team Roles:
* Kai Watanabe
  *
* Jack (Yueshuwei Wu)
  * In charge of analyzing the contents that users post on Twitter regarding to the COVID vaccine. Jack will analyse patterns of content quantitatively using statistical methods and qualitative methods to analyse meanings of content within texts. 
## Status update
* What is working:
 * We have sucessfully extracted locational data from the users' location description for mapping purposes.
 * We've find a way to evaluate the sentiment of a tweet as a feature of public vaccine approval.
* What is not working:
 * Did not find strong correlation between our discovery and the census data like race profiles.
## Data update
* Data source: Pfizer Vaccine Tweets https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/pfizer-vaccine-tweets
* We want to do a detailed analysis on the public's approval of the Pizfer COVID vaccine. By now, we have found that the majority of Twitter users either have a positive or nuetral sentiment score on the vaccine, which may indicates acceptance and approval. Interestingly, we observed a siginificantly more negative sentiment scores from Indian users.
## Concerns
* Major Concerns
 * How can we extract topics from tweets? (Working on some math right now.)
* Minor concerns
 * Do we have to use census data?
